This is an application meant as assistance for RPG game masters. It will surely be further modified, with more names and species added, as well as possibly other functionalities.

The initial release contains a set of 16 male, 16 female and 16 family names for each species, and 40 universal nicknames.

Add - adds name to list.
Remove - removes last element from list. Please note you can also double left-click any name to remove it.
Blank - removes all names from list.
Export - saves the list of names as a .txt file on chosen location.
